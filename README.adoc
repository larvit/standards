= Larv IT software development standards, policys and more

== Software goals

* Clear and well documented API
* Have default settings wherever possible (to minimize configuration), but always allow overrides
* It should not cause you to change your workflow against your wishes - don't enforce opinions on users (Taken from renovate)
* All behaviour should be configurable, down to a ridiculous level if desired (Taken from renovate)
* Put a good effort in good naming - API calls, variables, functions, methods

== Build/Test policy

* Always strive to use official docker images in builds
* Avoid installing third party packages in tests, for example apt-get etc. Instead pre-built images should be used, ideally official images from upstream.
* Always use lock-files if they exists (for example package-lock.json for node-projects)
